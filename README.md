# SALES ANALYTICS: APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO SALES PREDICTION

# Data Set: 
  ### 1 - Sales and customers info from a local e-commerce fashion company offering women's coutures in different brands exported from United States to overseas.   
  ### 2 - Marketing campaign postings info from its social media platform

# Time scope for analyses:  
01/01/2017 - 03/31/2018

# Inspirations / Questions: 

### 1 - Analyses of sales vs. category, brand, price range: Which categories are the most profitable ones? What is the sweet point of the price range for the company's existing customers? 
### 2 - Prediction of future sales based on the past sales history, and prospective marketing strategies; 
### 3 - Comparison of the value that each brand brings to the company - by including the campaign frequency factor into the formula (linear regression in machine learning): Which brand the company should drop and instead focus on more valuable brands? Sales prediction for campaigns towards different brands, and pricing strategy based on the above model.
### 4 - RFM analysis on customer segamentations: Who are the best customers? Which customers are almost lost that the company might want to send reminders/incentives to get them back?    


# Concepts:
### Python / Pandas: Cleaning and plotting data
### Machine learning: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, NLP 
### Tableau: Reports and story-telling
### HTML/CSS/Javascript: Front-end interface 
### Apache Spark 
### Apache Spark ML
### Azure cloud
### HDInsight
### Data Pipeline (Realtime streaming)


# Future Efforts:
### 1 - Create a more systemized platform for the company's input of sales and customers profiles, which would automatically generate report visualization (real-time), and forecast the results of certain marketing strategies.
### 2 - Applying machine learning to automatically suggest sizes for customers on the brands they have never purchased before, based on the input of their body type and measurements, the history of other brands' purchase, and other customers' sizing selections.
